# BookChat Server Refactoring Log

## Date: 2025-01-15

### Modularization Plan

The server.py file will be split into the following modules:

1. `server/`
   - `__init__.py` - Package initialization
   - `main.py` - Entry point and server startup
   - `handler.py` - Request handler implementation
   - `config.py` - Configuration and environment setup
   - `logger.py` - Logging configuration
   - `utils.py` - Utility functions

### Design Decisions

1. **Module Separation**
   - Each module will be limited to 50 lines or fewer
   - Functionality is grouped by concern
   - Clear separation between configuration, request handling, and server setup

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variables and constants moved to config.py
   - Centralized configuration management

3. **Logging**
   - Dedicated logger.py module for all logging setup
   - Maintains existing logging levels and handlers
   - Separate loggers for different components

4. **Request Handler**
   - Split into smaller, focused methods
   - Improved error handling and response management

### Changes Made

1. Created server directory structure
2. Moved logging configuration to dedicated module
3. Separated request handler into its own file
4. Centralized configuration management
5. Created main entry point file

### Interface

The public interface remains unchanged:
- Server starts on the same port (default 8000)
- All existing endpoints maintained
- Same environment variable configuration
- Identical logging behavior
